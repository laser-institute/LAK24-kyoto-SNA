To support scholars’ conceptual understanding of SNA as both a theoretical perspective and an analytical method, the instructors will provide short presentations and facilitate peer discussion on topics ranging from broad applications of SNA in educational contexts to specific approaches for data collection and storage. This course will also provide you with applied experience analyzing network data through code-alongs and interactive case studies that use widely adopted tools (e.g., R, RStudio, and GitHub) and demonstrate common techniques (e.g, network visualization, measurement, and modeling). Collectively, these activities will help you both appreciate and experience how SNA can be used to understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs."
