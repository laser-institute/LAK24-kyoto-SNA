To support scholars’ conceptual understanding of SNA as both a theoretical perspective and an analytical method, the instructors will provide short presentations and facilitate peer discussion on topics ranging from broad applications of SNA in educational contexts to specific approaches for data collection and storage. This course will also provide you with applied experience analyzing network data through code-alongs and interactive case studies that use widely adopted tools (e.g., R, RStudio, and GitHub) and demonstrate common techniques (e.g, network visualization, measurement, and modeling). Collectively, these activities will help you both appreciate and experience how SNA can be used to understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs.\n\n-   Workshop material can be found in the workshop [LAK SNA github repository](https://github.com/laser-institute/LAK24-kyoto-SNA).\n\n\n::: callout\n#### Learning Objectives\n\nAt the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to\n\n**Theory Comprehension:** Acquire knowledge on the theoretical underpinning of social network analysis, and understand its application in solving critical problems and addressing pertinent questions in the educational sector.\n\n**Identifying Data and Metrics:** Learn to pinpoint potential data sources for network analysis, and familiarize oneself with related metrics such as centrality and degree.
