Welcome to **An Introduction to Social Network Analysis and Education
Research: Core Concepts and Applications with R**! This workshop is not
only part of the 2023 AERA Virtual Research Learning Series, but part of
the broader work of the [Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research
(LASER) Institute](https://fi.ncsu.edu/projects/laser-institute/), a
professional development program for early and mid-career researchers
funded by the National Science Foundation (ECR: BCSER). To help you
prepare for our workshop this Thursday, August 10, 2023, from 1:00pm to
5:00pm (EST), provided below is some information about the
organizational aspects of the workshop as well as the technical
components you will need to fully participate.

## Overview

This workshop is designed to introduce education researchers with little
or no background in SNA to social network theory, examples of network
analysis in educational contexts, and applied experience analyzing
real-world data sets. To support scholars' conceptual understanding of
SNA as both a theoretical perspective and an analytical method, the
instructors will provide short presentations and facilitate peer
discussion on topics ranging from broad applications of SNA in
educational contexts to specific approaches for data collection and
storage. This course will also provide you with applied experience
analyzing network data through code-alongs and interactive case studies
that use widely adopted tools (e.g., R, RStudio, and GitHub) and
demonstrate common techniques (e.g, network visualization, measurement,
and modeling). Collectively, these activities will help you both
appreciate and experience how SNA can be used to understand and improve
student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs.

## LASER Institute Toolkit

### Posit Cloud

For our broader LASER Institute program and for this workshop as well,
we will make extensive use of **Posit Cloud**
(<https://posit.co/products/cloud/cloud/>). Posit Cloud lets you access
Posit's powerful set of data science tools like the **RStudio IDE**
([https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)),
an integrated development environment (IDE) for R and Python that
includes a console and syntax-highlighting editor, as well as tools for
plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management. Since Posit
Cloud is accessed right in your browser, there is no installation or
complex configuration required.

Prior to the workshop, you will need to register for a free Posit Cloud
account at: <https://login.posit.cloud/register>.

#### AERA SNA Workshop 2023 Workspace

During the workshop, you will need to access our **AERA SNA Workshop
2023**, where we will host the `network-analysis` RStudio project and
instructional materials it contains. To access this workspace, use the
following link: [go.ncsu.edu/sna-labs](https://go.ncsu.edu/sna-labs).
RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into
multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace,
history, and source documents. To learn more, visit:
<https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects>.

If you've accessed the workspace correctly, you should see something
like this:

### Posit Primers & Cheat Sheets

To make this most of this workshop it is helpful to have some basic
working knowledge of R. If you are new to R, we highly recommend taking
advantage of the great resources provided through Posit Cloud for
learning R. For example, **Posit Primers**
(<https://posit.cloud/learn/primers>) provide an excellent series of
interactive tutorials that range from R fundamentals like basic
programming syntax to complex tasks like building interactive data
dashboards. Specifically, we strongly encourage you to complete [The
Basics](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1) primer consisting of:

1.  [Visualization Basics](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.1): Start
    here and begin making plots with R. Plots are one of the most
    important tools for data science; they are also one of the most fun.
2.  [Programming Basics](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2): This
    tutorial demystifies programming with R. Here, you'll learn how to
    run functions and build objects.

**Posit** **Cheat Sheets** (<https://posit.cloud/learn/cheat-sheets>)
also provide handy reference to commonly used packages and their
essential functions, including example code for testing them out.

## Learn More

Finally, if you are interested in learning more about the LASER
Institute and are considering applying for our 2024 cohort, we encourage
you to visit our [LASER Institute
website](https://fi.ncsu.edu/projects/laser-institute/) and the [2023
Welcome
Packet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cpd4Q4U5MroFyVc1x3-z39wmO0kMdp2bzA3ftQ-zWRs/edit?usp=sharing).

Take care and we'll see you all soon!!
