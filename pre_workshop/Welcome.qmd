Welcome to **An Introduction to Social Network Analysis and Education
Research: Core Concepts and Applications with R**! This workshop is not
only part of the 2024 14th International Learning and Knowledge
Confernce(LAK24) , but part of the broader work of the [Learning
Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER)
Institute](https://fi.ncsu.edu/projects/laser-institute/), a
professional development program for early and mid-career researchers
funded by the National Science Foundation (ECR: BCSER). To help you
prepare for our workshop this Thursday, August 10, 2023, from 1:00pm to
5:00pm (EST), provided below is some information about the
organizational aspects of the workshop as well as the technical
components you will need to fully participate.

## Overview

This workshop is designed to introduce education researchers with little
or no background in SNA to social network theory, examples of network
analysis in educational contexts, and applied experience analyzing
real-world data sets. To support scholars' conceptual understanding of
SNA as both a theoretical perspective and an analytical method, the
instructors will provide short presentations and facilitate peer
discussion on topics ranging from broad applications of SNA in
educational contexts to specific approaches for data collection and
storage. This course will also provide you with applied experience
analyzing network data through code-alongs and interactive case studies
that use widely adopted tools (e.g., R, RStudio, and GitHub) and
demonstrate common techniques (e.g, network visualization, measurement,
and modeling). Collectively, these activities will help you both
appreciate and experience how SNA can be used to understand and improve
student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs.
