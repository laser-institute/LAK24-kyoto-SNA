### Posit Cloud

For our broader LASER Institute program and for this workshop as well,
we will make extensive use of **Posit Cloud**
(<https://posit.co/products/cloud/cloud/>). Posit Cloud lets you access
Posit's powerful set of data science tools like the **RStudio IDE**
([https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)),
an integrated development environment (IDE) for R and Python that
includes a console and syntax-highlighting editor, as well as tools for
plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management. Since Posit
Cloud is accessed right in your browser, there is no installation or
complex configuration required.

Prior to the workshop, you will need to register for a free Posit Cloud
account at: <https://login.posit.cloud/register>.

#### LAK24 SNA Workspace

During the workshop, you will need to access our **LAK24 SNA
Workspace**, where we will host the `network-analysis` RStudio project
and instructional materials it contains. To access this workspace, use
the following link:
[go.ncsu.edu/sna-labs](https://go.ncsu.edu/sna-labs). RStudio projects
make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each
with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source
documents. To learn more, visit:
<https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects>.

If you've accessed the workspace correctly, you should see something
like this:

### Posit Primers & Cheat Sheets

To make this most of this workshop it is helpful to have some basic
working knowledge of R. If you are new to R, we highly recommend taking
advantage of the great resources provided through Posit Cloud for
learning R. For example, **Posit Primers**
(<https://posit.cloud/learn/primers>) provide an excellent series of
interactive tutorials that range from R fundamentals like basic
programming syntax to complex tasks like building interactive data
dashboards. Specifically, we strongly encourage you to complete [The
Basics](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1) primer consisting of:

1.  [Visualization Basics](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.1): Start
    here and begin making plots with R. Plots are one of the most
    important tools for data science; they are also one of the most fun.
2.  [Programming Basics](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2): This
    tutorial demystifies programming with R. Here, you'll learn how to
    run functions and build objects.

**Posit** **Cheat Sheets** (<https://posit.cloud/learn/cheat-sheets>)
also provide handy reference to commonly used packages and their
essential functions, including example code for testing them out.

## Learn More

Finally, if you are interested in learning more about the LASER
Institute and are considering applying for our 2024 cohort, we encourage
you to visit our [LASER Institute
website](https://fi.ncsu.edu/projects/laser-institute/).

Take care and we'll see you all soon!!
